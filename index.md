**Step 2** 
Make that you have VS code installed before. Open up your terminal in VS code using the terminal tab in the top right corner. This will allow you to login into your course-specific account using the command ssh cs15lfa22XX@ieng6.ucsd.edu while replacing the XX with the letters associated with your account.
